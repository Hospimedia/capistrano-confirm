= Capistrano Confirm

  Confirm before deploy.

  Make sure you are not deploying the wrong branch, and remind you should deploy it after code review!

  Please use it, because I write it after deployed a wrong branch to our production server! ;(

== Usage:

  1, Add it to your Gemfile:

    gem 'capistrano-confirm'

  2, Require it in your deploy config file, it should be `config/deploy.rb` for rails

    require "bundler/setup"
    require 'capistrano/confirm'

  3, Only want to confirm for some stages? customize `confirm_stages` as your like.

    For example, only want to confirm when deploying production, Add below to your deploy.rb
      set :confirm_stages, "production"

    Or confirm when deploying staging and production? Ok, Add something like this
      set :confirm_stages, [:production, :staging]
